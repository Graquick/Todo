## Project Description

In this project, I create a button which once clicked brings up a modal for adding a new todo item. The project focused around components and their states, as well as their props. To get the best result, a state management system like `Redux Toolkit` got the job done. All animations are done using `Framer Motion`.

> This project is my first with `Redux Toolkit`. Learning a new technology is much easier for me when I get to implement it in something real, like this project. I learnt mostly by reading docs and watching videos. Understanding state management in React is essential, since it enables the development of more complex applications. I'm looking forward to using this techonology in the future!
